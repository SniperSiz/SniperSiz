- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SniperSiz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development and the challenging aspects that come with it. Particullay becoming a full stack developer. I believer knowing both front end and
back end developing can give you a niche.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of HTML/JavaScript/CSS and how to work with the languages and build websites.
I am still very new in this field but working hard and putting in the hours to become better than I was yesterday.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me will be via email Smpato68@gmail.com
